Here you can quickly edit multiple pages at once. The list of pages consists of the selected root page and children of it.
</p>
<p>
Each field is updated upon leaving it. Changing <em>"title", "breadcrumb", "slug", "keywords", "description" and page parts</em> will change page "updated on" time.
</p>
<p>
You can also edit page parts but only those <strong>without filter</strong> applied. Page parts with filters are listed below each page.
