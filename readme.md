MultiEdit for Wolf CMS
======================

Plugin for editing multiple pages interactively.

This plugin helps you to edit multiple pages based on jQuery, so you don't have to wait for page reload and click "Save and continue editing" to see the changes.  All changes are made (almost) instantly. If you want you can also edit pages' metadata and parts in **frontend**.

MultiEdit provides page parts editing and changing names of existing page parts. If you have Part Revisions plugin enabled, the changes in page part contents will be stored as a revision.

Installation
------------

MultiEdit Plugin can be installed into your WolfCMS by uploading it to ***CMS_ROOT/wolf/plugins/multiedit/*** and enabling it in administration panel.
